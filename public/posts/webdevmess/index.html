  <p>I started learning HTML and CSS a decade ago, 2015. Back in intermediate school my teacher introduced me to a tool known as <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a>. I started using it obsessively to express and to present <a href="https://neocities.org/site/valuesforkids">things</a> in my class. And over the next decade I stuck to neocities for the benefits that it gave to me for free. But I&rsquo;ve always desired my own website domain and learning how to make a website &ldquo;professionally&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So this August I decided to take on Hugo and learn how to genuinely make my own website. I&rsquo;ve spent many years coding in HTML and CSS to the point of being highly proficient in it, so it&rsquo;s now time to actually showcase that.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-project">The Project</h3>
<p>My goal was simple: make a blog website. Using some css and html code I had left over from a previous project I scrambled up together a nice, simple, accessible layout. The CSS was based off <a href="https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/">the perfect mother fucking website</a> but heavily modified to suit my needs, like a new colour and some stylisation choices like the navbar. I also wanted to avoid using javascript because I want to have as much of the website accessible without anything but the HTML file, so even if you delete the stylesheet right now you can still navigate and read the entire website.</p>
<p>Now It was onto learning Hugo. It was initially quite easy, but then it got quite hard, so hard that I decided to give up for a couple hours and go back to raw html and css, until I gave up on that and tried Hugo again and it was a cakewalk. The lesson here is to give yourself breaks, but also waste a couple hours on useless troubleshooting. &ldquo;Work hard not smart&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buying a Web Domain is scary, because you will have to stick with it for quite a while, because if you don&rsquo;t like your domain, you will need to fork out some money for a new domain, which for me isn&rsquo;t a fun thing to do. Initially I wanted to go for funicular, my online alias, but getting a nice domain for it is a little awkward. After some thinking, I thought my real name would be a good choice, but I feared that using such a personal piece of information may lead to bad actors using it against me.</p>
<p>So I was in a real pickle here, and It took a while, but I finally settled on &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; for my domain name, which I felt was satisfactory enough. I finally set the entire thing up on github as my host for the time being and here we are now!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The website will continue to be under construction for a while longer, and I will also continue to optimize and clean up the website. I also will eventually introduce a projects page, where projects that I finish, or are at least presentable, will be shown there!</p>
<p>If this sounded chaotic or crazy, all i can say is this accurately frames how my brain felt building the website, and then trying to explain what i did afterwards.</p>
