    Aug 15, 2025
    <p>I have been working on a small project involving my hometown&rsquo;s commercial centre, Homedale village. Historically it used to be Wainuiomata&rsquo;s main commercial centre but in more recent history it has become rundown.</p>
<p>My project&rsquo;s goal is to just simply suggest how the village could be redeveloped. I feel that this is necessary to do now more than any time because of the rest of the suburb&rsquo;s development and recent proposals for PuketahƒÅ wildlife sanctuary gives the village a unique position as the ecological hub of the Hutt. But what it needs to get there is a proper redevelopment that brings modernity and community to the village.</p></div>

    Aug 12, 2025
    <p>I started learning HTML and CSS a decade ago, 2015. Back in intermediate school my teacher introduced me to a tool known as <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a>. I started using it obsessively to express and to present <a href="https://neocities.org/site/valuesforkids">things</a> in my class. And over the next decade I stuck to neocities for the benefits that it gave to me for free. But I&rsquo;ve always desired my own website domain and learning how to make a website &ldquo;professionally&rdquo;.</p></div>
