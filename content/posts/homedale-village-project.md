I have been working on a small project involving my hometown's commercial centre, Homedale village. Historically it used to be Wainuiomata's main commercial centre but in more recent history it has become rundown.

My project's goal is to just simply suggest how the village could be redeveloped. I feel that this is necessary to do now more than any time because of the rest of the suburb's development and recent proposals for Puketahā wildlife sanctuary gives the village a unique position as the ecological hub of the Hutt. But what it needs to get there is a proper redevelopment that brings modernity and community to the village.

There is a lot going on here, especially compared to what is here currently so we will break it down.

A new dedicated space for parking: We need to increase parking in this area to encourage more people to stop by on their travels, this also includes accessibility parking for those who need it. The island between the parking lot and the road ensures that pedestrians nearby can safely and efficiently move by without making serious deviations. The 170 bus route was also moved up onto that island to make accessing the shops easier and quicker.

A venue building: I notice that there is not a dedicated town hall styled building anywhere nearby, and we instead use the primary school’s assembly hall for things like discussions and voting, so I feel like we could instead have a dedicated building towards that kind of activity, and for any group to use, which would help at building a community.

Mixed buildings: Some of the builds would house apartments on their second floors. This is a good way at ensuring a sense of the village not being just a commercial centre but also a community centre.
